Declare an address named oracleAddress. Make it private, and don't assign it to anything.

Next, create a function called setOracleInstanceAddress. This function takes an address argument named _oracleInstanceAddress. It's a public function, and it doesn't return anything.

The first line of code should set oracleAddress to _oracleInstanceAddress
